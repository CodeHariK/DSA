# [297. Serialize and Deserialize Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/serialize-and-deserialize-binary-tree/description/)

Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits so that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer, or transmitted across a network connection link to be reconstructed later in the same or another computer environment.

Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary tree. There is no restriction on how your serialization/deserialization algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that a binary tree can be serialized to a string and this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.

Clarification: The input/output format is the same as how LeetCode serializes a binary tree. You do not necessarily need to follow this format, so please be creative and come up with different approaches yourself.

```py
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode(object):
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None

class Codec:

    def serialize(self, root):
        res = []
        def dfs(root):
            if not root:
                res.append('N')
                return
            res.append(str(root.val))
            dfs(root.left)
            dfs(root.right)
        dfs(root)
        return ','.join(res)

        

    def deserialize(self, data):
        vals = deque(data.split(','))
        def dfs():
            val = vals.popleft()
            if not val or val=='N':
                return None
            root = TreeNode(int(val))
            root.left = dfs()
            root.right = dfs()
            return root
        return dfs()
        

# Your Codec object will be instantiated and called as such:
# ser = Codec()
# deser = Codec()
# ans = deser.deserialize(ser.serialize(root))
```
